# pu221e5-ucode19

This was created in the 36 hours uCode hackathon by Adidas in 2019. It used Artificial Intelligence to identify clothing products and redirected the user to Adidas's website with a search query related to the item. 

This was all hosted in a Node.js website using AWS tools such as Rekognition for the AI or S3 storage to send the images and analyze them. C++ was also used to process the tags found by Rekognition and save an url to the website to redirect the user from the website. Please note that it was a rushed project and made by freshmen so it isn't really the best example of how it should be done. Anyhow, it as a really fun and interesting experience that taught us a lot about programming.
